This is just the frontend - app part of the system, as is mostly used to experiment with OpenLayers to create the floor plan, and add elements in the building.

## How to use

Link the repo to PhoneGap Build. Then compile and package your app. In minutes, youâ€™ll receive the download URLs for all mobile platforms.
For iOS apps you will need a developer certificate

## Final thoughts
For now the app only has window blinds, but different devices can be easily added.
